This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for job approval.\
Simple timer that can start, stop and reset time.

## Available Scripts

As in a CRA, you can run those scripts in the project directory:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
